@incollection{Teske98,
	abstract = {In Pollard's rho method, an iterating function f is used to define a sequence (yi) by yi+1=f(yi) for i=0,1, 2,..., with some starting value y0. In this paper, we define and discuss new iterating functions for computing discrete logarithms with the rho method. We compare their performances in experiments with elliptic curve groups. Our experiments show that one of our newly defined functions is expected to reduce the number of steps by a factor of approximately 0.8, in comparison with Pollard's originally used function, and we show that this holds independently of the size of the group order. For group orders large enough such that the run time for precomputation can be neglected, this means a real-time speed-up of more than 1.2.},

@article{Gallant2000,
abstract = {The best algorithm known for finding logarithms on an elliptic curve (E) is the (parallelized) Pollard lambda collision search. We show how to apply a Pollard lambda search on a set of equivalence classes derived from E, which requires fewer iterations than the standard approach. In the case of anomalous binary curves over F_{2^m}, the new approach speeds up the standard algorithm by a factor of \sqrt{2m}.},
